# ## Classes Project -- Student Information System

# #### Introduction:
# 
# At Lawrenceville, there are three main computer systems that we utilize, to manage all the business of the school:
# 
# - Canvas... our Learning Management System (LMS), which is written in Ruby on Rails.
# - Blackbaud... our Client Management Sytem (CMS), which handles all the financial information for the school.  Couldn't figure out what it's written in.
# - Veracross - our Student Information System (SMS), which is written in a combination of Javascript, Python, and SQL.
# 
# The purpose of an SIS is to store all the information about the students, parents, and employees that are related to the school.  Large database systems that involve specialized data types (like employees or parents or students) are almost always written using Object-Oriented programming (i.e. classes) because you can tailor each object to the information being stored.  For instance, you don't need to collect and store the same information about a parent as you do a student or an employee.  You can also create additional objects for anything else you might need to store, like grades, transcripts, etc.
# 
# #### The Task:
# 
# Your task for this project is to create an SIS for a school.  Don't worry--you don't need to create a complete one, as that would take months even working together.  But we do want to build the basic pieces that one would need to have students in a school taking classes and recording grades.  
# 
# #### The Details:
# 
# For this task you will create three different classes and an interface that will allow the user to interact with them.  Listed below are the minimum requirements for the different classes.  You are free to build them out, adding other attributes and/or methods as you have time. Here are the classes you will need to create:
# 
# <u>#1 - Grade:</u>  This class should have at least three attributes, one to hold the letter grade, one to hold the course the grade was earned in, and one for the term that it was earned in.  It should also have one method that converts the grade to its GPA equivalent.
# 
# <u>#2 - Student:</u>  This class should have the following attributes plus any others you wish to add:
# 
# - sid = student sid 
# - last = last name
# - first = first name
# - address = their address
# - form = what form they are in
# - house = what House they are in
# - email = should actually be a property that is created dynamically as we did in class
# - course_dict = starts out as an empty dictionary that can be filled later.  We aren't going to create a class object called course (unless you have time and want to!) so entries in this dictionary can be as simple as the period as the key and the course name as a string for the value.  Something like {"C":"MA564: Advanced Python", "A":"VA440: Ceramics", etc.}, for example.
# - grade_list = starts out as an empty list that can be filled later with Grade objects.
# 
# The Student class should also have the following methods plus any more that you want to add:
# 
# - add_course... adds a course to the their course list.  You will obviously need to feed it the period and the course.
# 
# - drop course... should list off all their courses and allow the user to delete one.
# 
# - calculate_GPA... should go through all the Grade objects in the grade_list and calculate an overall GPA.
# 
# - change_info... allows the user to change the address, first name, or last name.
# 
# - a string operator that prints out the student name, form, and House.
# 
# - enter_grades... loops through course_dict and allows the student to enter a grade for each course.
# 
# 
# <u>#3 School:</u> This class holds all the students for your school.  It only needs four attributes - the school name (i.e. "Lawrenceville"), the current term (T1, T2 or T3), the school year (like 2023), and a dictionary of students, which starts out empty.  This class should have at least three methods:
# 
# - add_student = adds the student object the dictionary, with id as the key and the student object as the value
# 
# - remove_student = removes the student from the student dictionary
# 
# - print_students = loops through the student dictioanry and prints their id, name, email, and House
# 
# - set_term = this should be a property (so not exactly a method) and will return something like "Fall 2023" if the term is T1 and the year is 2023.
# 
# Once you have those three classes created and working, your final task is to create an interface that allows the user to interact with these three classes.  Your main interface should either load (if you want to attempt some pickling!) or create a school class and allow the user to add students to the dictionary and run any of the School methods.  It allow you should also let you access a second menu that allows you to access all the methods of the student class, like adding a course, entering grades, etc.  
# 
# #### Miscellaneous Details:
# 
# - You will have 3 days in class (including one long-block class) plus 4 nights of homework to complete this project.  The project is due on Tuesday, April 4th.  After the 4th, there will be 5% late penalty for each day the project is late.  If more time is needed as a class (first time doing this project!) we can make those adjustments in the syllabus.
# 
# - Grading will be based on the rubric provided in class.  
# 
# - I strongly suggest that you build each class (any order) and thoroughly test them before you move on to the next class.  Do them in different cells of a notebook so that you know each portion works.  The interface will likely take the most work, so save that for last.
# 
# - Make sure that your code is well documented and commented, particularly those portions that you add that are not part of the original assignment!

#below is a function, entitled func, that is extremely useful for code efficiency, as I previously had the same
#block of code copied/pasted across 5 different methods which could be cleaned up with one all-econompassing function. 

#essentially, func will take an input (sid) and a desired method; it will search through Student object (which
# are contained in my_list) matches the inputted sid and then it will run the user's desired method using said
# Student object. If the desired method requires arguments, the function takes up to two arguments (as that is 
# the max number of arguments that the methods within the above classes take) and will appropriately 
# run the method with the right number of arguments. For example, the add_course method requires two arguments -- 
# that is, the letter period and name of the course -- so method_atr1 and method_atr2 (defined below) will both 
#not be set to None. On the other hand, the method community serivce does not require any arguments, so I will call 
# on func(input, 'community_service') and the function will find the Student object based corresponding to an inputted 
# sid and then run the community_service method within the Student class for said unique student.

# General Notes about project and 20 error handling/edge case considerations:

#Project (went above and beyond project requirements):
# 1. ## added community_service method to Student class and allowed said method to be accessed in menu via UI
# #said method provides useful info on whether of not the student has fufilled their CS reqs based on num LCAPS/OTEs
# 2 ## asked user for free period (where free period was never an attribute/project requirement)
#and handled error of the niche case in which user wants to enter grade for their free period, which isn't sensible!

#List of all the 20 Error Handling/Edge Case Considerations I've done:
# 1. #the user tries to drop a course that has never been inputted.
# 2. # the user tries to calculate_GPA if no courses were added/all courses were removed (ie. grade_list is empty).
# 3. #handled error of user trying to add grades for a free period.
# 4. ## handles niche error of invalid free period entry (ie. not 'A','B','C','D','E', or 'F')
# 5. ## handles error of invalid letter grade entry (ie. not "A+", "A", "A-", and so on and so forth)
# 6. ## handles error of invalid term entry (ie. not T1, T2, or T2)
# 8.## handles error where the user tries to enter grades if no courses were added/all courses were removed.
# 9. ##handles error of non-integer inputs for number of LCAPS/OTEs the student has completed.
# 10. ## handles edge case of when user inputs negative number for numbers of LCAPS/OTEs the student has completed.
# 11. ## handles all combinations of valid integer inputs for number of LCAPS/OTEs (ie. 6 OTEs and 0 LCAPS handled)
# 12.#considers edge case where the user tries to add a student with an sis that already exists within the SIS.
## which cannot happen in real life, as all sids are unique!
# 13.  handles case where the user enters a desired method that doesn't exist (ie. chooses method not on the menu).
#14. handles case where inputted sid is not an integer (ie. 'pizza')
# 15. handles case where inputted form DNE (ie. form = 6) or form = 'pizza' (only valid forms are 2-5, inclusive)!
#16. handles case where user inputs invalid house (ie. inputs 'pizza' or inputs '7'); only valid houses are
#the ones in the circle/cresent (ie. Kennedy, Kirby, etc. )
#17. handles case where a second former tries to put a non-lower house; isn't possible because a freshmen, for instance, 
## cannot be in Kennedy or Kirby (only 3-5th formers, inclusive, can be in circle/crescent houses)
#18. handles case where the user enters an invalid period for a course (ie. 'K' period or 'pizza period')
## rather than A,B,C,D,E, or F period, which are the only valid entries!
#19. handles case where the user tries to drop a course that does not exist. 
#20. ensures that the user inputs a valid attribute to change in change_info method
